# Hand Cricket Game using CNN and MediaPipe

A project based on the IEEE paper presenting a hand gesture-based cricket game. Player gestures are detected in real time using computer vision techniques and converted to game actions.

## Abstract
Implements hand cricket where player gestures are recognized via webcam using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MediaPipe models. Achieves 97.67% accuracy on hand gesture recognition.

## Features
- Real-time gesture recognition for cricket moves
- Two implementation approaches: custom CNN and MediaPipe
- Python, OpenCV, Keras, and MediaPipe used for development
- Interactive hand cricket gameplay with score calculation

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras
- MediaPipe
- Custom CNN for gesture classification

## How to Run
1. Collect or prepare gesture images for training.
2. Train gesture recognition model (CNN) or use MediaPipe.
3. Integrate with game logic to process gestures and calculate scores.
4. Run the application and interact via webcam.
